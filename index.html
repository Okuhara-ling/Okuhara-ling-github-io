    <p><strong>Malaysia</strong> is a country in Southeast Asia. <br>It is a federation which has 13 states.
      It is divided into two parts by the South China Sea. Its mainland is on the Malay Peninsula.
      It faces the Straits of Malacca on its west coast and the South China Sea on its east coast.
      The other part of this country, sometimes known as East Malaysia, is on the northern part of the island of Borneo in the South China Sea.
      Kuala Lumpur on the Malay Peninsula is its capital. The federal capital was recently moved to Putrajaya, a newly created city exclusively designed for administration.
      The country is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, with most people being Malay, but there are also Chinese and Indians. Its official language is Malay written in the Latin alphabet.
      English is a recognised language and also the official language in Sarawak state along with Malay. Tamil and Chinese is also often used.
      There are over 130 other languages spoken in Malaysia, with 94 in Malaysian Borneo and 40 on the peninsula. Islam is the official religion,

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Between China and India, Malaysia was an ancient <strong>trading place</strong>. When Europeans came to this area, Malacca became an important trade port.
      The states of Malaysia became <strong>a colony of the British Empire</strong>, starting with <em>Penang</em> in 1786.
      The peninsular part became independent on 31 August 1957 as the <strong>Federation of Malaya</strong>.
      In September 1963, Malaya, Singapore and the Borneo part joined together to become Malaysia.
      In 1965, <strong>Singapore</strong> was expelled from the federation and declared independence.
